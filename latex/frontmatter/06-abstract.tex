This work presents the development of an adaptive assessment system designed for higher education environments. The main objective of the system is to accurately estimate students' knowledge levels and to personalize learning activities accordingly. The proposed approach is based on a hybrid model that combines Item Response Theory (IRT) with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing techniques.

The system is implemented as a decoupled adaptive engine capable of interacting with external content generation components. Validation is carried out through computational simulation using virtual students, evaluating accuracy, stability, and performance metrics. The results demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed model and its potential applicability in personalized learning systems.
